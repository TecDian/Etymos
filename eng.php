$loc_projekt_antwort1 = 'ANSWER: First of all, this is, of course, not a question, but an expression of opinion. However, it is one we read quite often, but not always so drastically formulated, although sometimes even more drastically. The dictionaries are edited in <span class="key">unpaid spare time</span> as a future project. Such a task needs time. Although maybe accurate, <span class="state">blanket criticism</span> is unhelpful and therefore <span class="sourcelight">explicitly unwelcome</span>. After all, everyone can inform themselves otherwise if they find the material provided by us insufficient.';
$loc_projekt_frage2 = 'QUESTION: According to which criteria was the vocabulary of the dictionaries compiled?';
$loc_projekt_antwort2 = 'ANSWER: The compilation does not constitute a representative selection from the vocabulary of the languages, but results from the currently digitally available data. It covers all areas of verbal communication, colloquial language and slang as well as newspapers, media and literary language as well as the technical languages ​​of various scientific, technical and cultural areas. Appart from this rather unsystematic extension, we aim at systematically building up the vocabulary. Accordingly, there are several <span class="key">revision levels</span>.';
$loc_projekt_frage3 = 'QUESTION: Which revision levels for the dictionaries are there?';
$loc_projekt_antwort3a = 'ANSWER: The revision level is determined according to two criteria. The first criterion is the <span class="key">minimum quality of all entries</span>.';
$loc_projekt_antwort3b = 'Filling with <span class="level1">basic entries</span>';
$loc_projekt_antwort3c = 'Building all entries up to at least <span class="level2">revision entry 1</span>';
$loc_projekt_antwort3d = 'Building all entries up to at least <span class="level3">revision entry 2</span>';
$loc_projekt_antwort3e = 'Building all entries up to at least <span class="level4">revision entry 3</span>';
$loc_projekt_antwort3f = 'Final revision of all entries as <span class="level7">full entries</span>';
$loc_projekt_antwort3g = 'The second criterion is the <span class="key">vocabulary coverage</span>. For this purpose graded standard vocabularies of various sizes are developed. On the one hand they are based on a frequency analysis of a large number of modern texts, on the other hand special consideration is given to particular conversation situations and usage scenarios.';
$loc_projekt_antwort3h = 'unspecific, automatically generated <span class="key">word collection</span>';
$loc_projekt_antwort3i = 'at least <span class="key">key vocabulary</span> <span class="state">~1.000</span> words, basic communication';
$loc_projekt_antwort3j = 'at least <span class="key">key vocabulary</span> <span class="state">~4.000</span> words, everyday communication';
$loc_projekt_antwort3k = 'at least <span class="key">advanced vocabulary</span> <span class="state">~10.000</span> words, extended text coverage';
$loc_projekt_antwort3l = 'at least <span class="key">advanced vocabulary</span> <span class="state">~40.000</span> words, comprehensive text coverage';
$loc_projekt_antwort3m = '<span class="key">universal vocabulary</span> <span class="state">&gt;40.000</span> words, text coverage as complete as possible';
$loc_projekt_frage4 = 'QUESTION: Which revision levels for the entries are there?';
$loc_projekt_antwort4 = 'ANSWER: We aim at <span class="key">verifying</span> all entries as best as possible and add information about <span class="plane">semantics</span>, <span class="name">grammar</span> and <span class="phon">phonetics</span>. There are seven <span class="key">revision levels</span>, identified by different symbols.';
$loc_projekt_frage5 = 'QUESTION: Why do inflection classes, grammatical descriptions, and pronunciation information at Etymos differ from those found in other dictionaries?';
$loc_projekt_antwort5 = 'ANSWER: We use a strictly <span class="key">scientific approach</span>. Thus we do not follow traditional linguistics, often interspersed with <span class="sourcelight">nationalist ideology</span> and <span class="sourcelight">literary aesthetics</span>, which so often describes things as they should be in the opinion of individual authors, rather than as they really are. This leads to certain deviations, which are greatest, but also most meaningful and useful, for the description of inflections. Those who have not dealt with these matters anyway will simply be pleased with the clarity of our system. Those who are used to other things and venture on our system will be rewarded with easy-to-use symbols and schemes and meaningful connections. Those who can see neither the meaning nor the benefit of our system are again referred to other possible providers.';
$loc_mitwirkung = 'Assistance';
$loc_mitwirkung_frage1 = 'QUESTION: The web site is not completely translated. May I help?';
$loc_mitwirkung_antwort1 = 'ANSWER: <span class="markwhite">Definitely!</span> Assistence in this area is very welcome. However, the language concerned should be your <span class="key">primary language</span> or at least you should have <span class="key">very good knowledge</span> of it. <span class="sourcelight">Please no automatic translations!</span>';
$loc_mitwirkung_frage2 = 'QUESTION: May I submit proposals for missing words?';
$loc_mitwirkung_antwort2 = 'ANSWER: We have barely managable large amounts of verified source material, enought to keep us busy integrating it for a very long time. Editing single proposals that still needed to be verified would disrupt the workflow and ultimately cost more time than to continue working on the existing material, making it <span class="key">inefficient</span>. <span class="sourcelight">Therefore we can not consider word suggestions.</span>';
$loc_mitwirkung_frage3 = 'QUESTION: May I suggest corrections if I find mistakes?';
$loc_mitwirkung_antwort3a = 'ANSWER: We are aware that our dictionaries contain many oddities and also mistakes, sometimes even grave ones. This is due to the fact that the initial filling of the database was done by machine data collection and classification. Again, however, the same argument applies as with new proposals: Editing individual corrections is significantly more <span class="key">inefficient</span> than systematic editing automatically generated entries. Therefore, we cannot consider corrective suggestions for <span class="level1">basic entries</span> and <span class="level2">revision entries 1</span>.';
$loc_mitwirkung_antwort3b = 'However, the situation is different for entries from <span class="level3">revision entry 2</span> on which were already manually revised. <span class="markwhite">We would be very grateful for corrections of mistakes in such an entry.</span> Mistakes may be reported via the contact form on the <a href="?site=imprint'.$lang_link.'">imprint</a>. Please specify the <span class="key">keyword</span> as well as the <span class="key">site, source, and target language</span> and describe the <span class="key">problem</span> and your <span class="key">solution</span> sufficiently exactly. It may be sensible to add a <span class="key">source</span>.';
$loc_mitwirkung_frage4 = 'QUESTION: I’d like to do more. May I join Etymos and collaborate on the project?';
$loc_mitwirkung_antwort4 = 'ANSWER: We’d like to welcome you as a new <span class="key">team member</span>. However, in contrast to many other free information sites Etymos doesn’t work on the basis of contributions by any user. We strive to use a scientific approach. Therefore we have certain <span class="key">minimum standards</span> for team members. For details see the job postings on our <a href="?site=team'.$lang_link.'">team site</a>.';
$loc_mitwirkung_frage5 = 'QUESTION: Do you have special material for me to advertise you?';
